# Space Mapper Privacy Policy

Space Mapper lets users track and map their own locations. When a user has location tracking switched on, the locations are stored only on that user's device unless that user decides to share them. Users can share their stored locations (along with time stamps and randomly generated user UUIDs) by exporting them and transfering them to another device using some other app (e.g. email), or they can share them through surveys that they can connect to Space Mapper. Those surveys are not part of Space Mapper itself and are not controlled by Space Mapper. It is up to the user to decide whether to share their location data at all and, if so, with whom and by what means. Space Mapper does not itself collect or store any data from users apart from what it enables users themselves to collected, store and control themselve on their own devices.
