# ✅ Git Flow + Build Flavors Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎉 Implementation Status: **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

The Git Flow + Build Flavors system has been successfully implemented and tested for the Wellbeing Mapper app. This system provides clean separation between production and beta builds using build-time configuration.

---

## 📊 Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. **Android Build Flavors** 
- ✅ `android/app/build.gradle` configured with production/beta flavors
- ✅ Different application IDs for side-by-side installation
- ✅ Different app names with beta branding
- ✅ Tested and verified working

#### 2. **iOS Configuration**
- ✅ `Info-Production.plist` - Production app configuration  
- ✅ `Info-Beta.plist` - Beta app configuration with beta branding
- ✅ Build script automatically switches Info.plist files
- ✅ Ready for iOS builds

#### 3. **Flutter Code Updates**
- ✅ `AppModeService` - Build flavor detection via `String.fromEnvironment('APP_FLAVOR')`
- ✅ Flavor-based mode availability (production: Private+Research, beta: all modes)
- ✅ Mode validation to prevent unavailable modes
- ✅ Updated `AppMode` model to remove hardcoded beta flag
- ✅ Fixed deprecated usage in `ChangeModeScreen`

#### 4. **Build System**
- ✅ `build-flavors.sh` - Comprehensive build script for both flavors
- ✅ VS Code tasks configuration for easy development
- ✅ Test script for verification
- ✅ Both Android APK and AAB generation

#### 5. **Documentation**
- ✅ Complete implementation guide (`GIT_FLOW_BUILD_FLAVORS_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ Usage instructions and troubleshooting
- ✅ Workflow documentation

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Commands

**Build Production Release:**
```bash
./build-flavors.sh production android   # Android production
./build-flavors.sh production ios       # iOS production
./build-flavors.sh production all       # Both platforms
```

**Build Beta Release:**
```bash
./build-flavors.sh beta android         # Android beta
./build-flavors.sh beta ios             # iOS beta
./build-flavors.sh beta all             # Both platforms
```

**Run in Development:**
```bash
# Production mode
flutter run --dart-define=APP_FLAVOR=production

# Beta mode  
flutter run --dart-define=APP_FLAVOR=beta
```

### VS Code Integration
Use VS Code Command Palette → "Tasks: Run Task" → Select:
- "Build Production Android"
- "Build Beta Android" 
- "Run Production Mode"
- "Run Beta Mode"

## 📱 App Behavior

### Production Builds (`APP_FLAVOR=production`)
- **App Name**: "Wellbeing Mapper"
- **Bundle ID**: `com.github.activityspacelab.wellbeingmapper.gauteng`
- **Available Modes**: Private, Research only
- **Features**: Clean production-ready interface
- **Target**: App Store submission

### Beta Builds (`APP_FLAVOR=beta`)  
- **App Name**: "Wellbeing Mapper Beta"
- **Bundle ID**: `com.github.activityspacelab.wellbeingmapper.gauteng.beta`
- **Available Modes**: Private, Research, App Testing
- **Features**: Full testing capabilities
- **Target**: Beta testing and development
