# Wellbeing Mapper - Research Participation & Encryption Features

## Overview

This document summarizes the major new features added to the Wellbeing Mapper app to support multi-site research participation with end-to-end encryption. These features enable secure data collection for research studies in Barcelona, Spain and Gauteng, South Africa.

## Key New Features

### 1. Three-Way Participation System ‚ú®

Users can now choose between three modes when starting the app:

- **üè† Private Mode**: Personal use only, no data sharing
- **üá™üá∏ Barcelona Research**: Participate in Spanish research study  
- **üáøüá¶ Gauteng Research**: Participate in South African research study

**Implementation:**
- `ParticipationSelectionScreen`: New UI for mode selection
- `ParticipationSettings` model: Manages participation preferences
- Site-specific participant code entry and validation

### 2. End-to-End Encryption System üîê

**Hybrid Encryption Approach:**
- **AES-256-GCM**: Fast encryption for data payload
- **RSA-4096-OAEP**: Secure key exchange using research team public keys
- **Unique session keys**: Fresh AES key for each upload (forward secrecy)

**Security Features:**
- Data encrypted on device before transmission
- Research teams can only decrypt with their private keys
- No personal identifying information transmitted
- Site isolation (separate keys for each research location)

**Implementation:**
- `DataUploadService`: Core encryption and upload service
- `ServerConfig`: Site-specific server and key configuration
- `EncryptionResult`: Encryption operation results
- `fast_rsa` package integration for RSA operations

### 3. Site-Specific Research Features üåç

**Barcelona Research:**

- Site-specific survey questions

**Gauteng Research:**
- South African demographics (ethnicity, building type)
- Health status tracking (general health questions)
- Suburb/area tracking for environmental correlation
- Local privacy compliance

**Implementation:**
- `ConsentFormScreen`: Dynamic consent based on research site
- Enhanced survey models with site-specific fields
- `SurveyModels`: Added `researchSite`, `suburb`, `generalHealth` fields

### 4. Secure Data Upload System üì§

**Features:**
- Bi-weekly automated upload scheduling
- Encrypted survey responses and location data
- Upload status tracking and retry logic
- Privacy-focused upload management UI

**Implementation:**
- `DataUploadScreen`: User interface for upload management
- `LocationTrack` model: Location data for research uploads
- Enhanced `SurveyDatabase`: Location tracking table and methods
- Upload synchronization and status tracking

### 5. Enhanced Database Schema üóÑÔ∏è

**New/Updated Tables:**
- `location_tracks`: GPS coordinates with accuracy and timestamps
- Enhanced survey tables with `research_site` field
- `consent_responses`: Complete consent tracking with all required fields

**Features:**
- Location data synchronized with uploads
- Site-specific survey storage
- Consent audit trail
- Local data retention management

### Multi-Site Configuration
```dart
static const Map<String, ServerConfig> _serverConfigs = {
  'barcelona': ServerConfig(
    baseUrl: 'https://barcelona-research.domain.com',
    uploadEndpoint: '/api/v1/participant-data',
    publicKey: '''-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    [RSA-4096 PUBLIC KEY FOR BARCELONA TEAM]
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----''',
  ),
  'gauteng': ServerConfig(
    baseUrl: 'https://gauteng-research.domain.com',
    uploadEndpoint: '/api/v1/participant-data',
    publicKey: '''-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    [RSA-4096 PUBLIC KEY FOR GAUTENG TEAM]
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----''',
  ),
};
```

## Research Team Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate RSA Key Pairs

For each research site, generate a 4096-bit RSA key pair:

```bash
# Barcelona keys
openssl genrsa -out barcelona_private_key.pem 4096
openssl rsa -in barcelona_private_key.pem -pubout -out barcelona_public_key.pem

# Gauteng keys  
openssl genrsa -out gauteng_private_key.pem 4096
openssl rsa -in gauteng_private_key.pem -pubout -out gauteng_public_key.pem
```

### 2. Configure Mobile App

**Update Public Keys:**
Edit `lib/services/data_upload_service.dart` and replace the public key placeholders with your generated public keys.

**Update Server URLs:**
Replace `baseUrl` values with your actual research server domains.

**Rebuild App:**
```bash
fvm flutter clean
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter build apk --release
```

### 3. Set Up Research Servers

**Required Components:**
- HTTPS server with valid SSL certificate
- REST API endpoint for encrypted data uploads
- Database for storing encrypted participant data
- Data processing pipeline with private key decryption

**API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/v1/participant-data
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "uploadId": "uuid-v4",
  "participantUuid": "uuid-v4", 
  "researchSite": "barcelona" | "gauteng",
  "encryptedData": "base64-encoded-payload",
  "encryptionMetadata": { ... },
  "dataPeriod": { "start": "...", "end": "..." }
}
```

### 4. Data Decryption

Server-side decryption example (Node.js):

```javascript
function decryptUpload(encryptedPayload, encryptionMetadata, privateKey) {
  const [encryptedAESKey, encryptedData] = encryptedPayload.split('|');
  
  // Decrypt AES key with RSA private key
  const aesKey = crypto.privateDecrypt({
    key: privateKey,
    padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
    oaepHash: 'sha256'
  }, Buffer.from(encryptedAESKey, 'base64'));
  
  // Decrypt data with AES-256-GCM
  const iv = Buffer.from(encryptionMetadata.iv, 'base64');
  const decipher = crypto.createDecipherGCM('aes-256-gcm', aesKey);
  // ... complete decryption process
  
  return JSON.parse(decryptedData);
}
```

## Decrypted Data Structure

After successful decryption, research teams receive:

```json
{
  "participantUuid": "anonymous-uuid",
  "researchSite": "barcelona" | "gauteng",
  "uploadTimestamp": "2025-07-23T10:30:00Z",
  "surveys": [
    {
      "type": "initial" | "recurring",
      "submittedAt": "2025-07-23T10:30:00Z",
      "responses": {
        "wellbeingScore": 1-10,
        "stressLevel": 1-10,
        "mood": "happy|neutral|sad|anxious|...",
        "suburb": "string",           // Gauteng only
        "generalHealth": "excellent|good|fair|poor",  // Gauteng only
        "ethnicity": "string",        // Site-specific options
        "buildingType": "string"      // Site-specific options
      }
    }
  ],
  "locationTracks": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-23T10:15:00Z",

      "longitude": 28.0567,
      "accuracy": 10.5
    }
  ]
}
```
